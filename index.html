              Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with transformative data that drives 
              actionable insights and fosters sustainability. By unifying and harmonizing data from diverse 
              carbon offset registries into a single, accessible platform, we are leading the way in creating 
              a more transparent and impactful path toward a sustainable future.

            <h2 id="text-only">What is Carbon Offset?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order 
              to compensate for emissions produced elsewhere. By investing in carbon offset projects, such as 
              reforestation or renewable energy, individuals and companies can balance out their own emissions.
            </p>
            <h2 id="text-only">About the Carbon Offset Market</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              In 2023, companies purchased and retired a record 164 million offsets, which was a 6% increase from 
              2022. The market is evolving rapidly, and some say it could grow to be worth $100 billion a year by 2030-35. 
              However, others say that without regulation, no one would pay for carbon emissions, and that heavy-emitting 
              companies could be criticized for having a right to pollute. There are two types of carbon offset markets: 
              voluntary and compliance.
            </p>
            <h3>Voluntary Markets</h3>
            <p class="text">
              These markets are not regulated, and organizations participate based on their own emissions reduction goals. 
              Individuals, companies, and other organizations can participate in voluntary markets, and consumers can buy 
              offsets to compensate for emissions from specific activities, like long flights.
            </p>
            <h3>Compliance Markets</h3>
            <p class="text">
              These markets are created by government regulations to reduce emissions, and some of the most active 
              compliance markets are in Europe and California.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Tool's Value</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Carbon AIQ provides immense value through the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project by unifying and harmonizing 
              data from multiple carbon offset registries into a single, accessible database. This platform streamlines 
              data processing through automated pipelines and advanced natural language processing (NL) and 
              classification algorithms to empower environmental researchers with clean, accurate data for informed 
              decision-making. This web interface enhances the value for current users of the Excel version of the database 
              by offering robust visualization tools and comprehensive reports, facilitating advanced research and effective 
              management of carbon offset initiatives.
            </p>
            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Also known as the PROJECT tab from the Current Registry's Excel tool, contains data on roughly 10,000 projects, 
              useful for a project type classification problem and other potential research inquiries. The underlying data 
              for the current registry includes raw data downloaded from American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action 
              Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard, and Verified Carbon Standard. More information on this data can be found 
              in the About BCTP tab.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Berkeley Carbon Trading Project's Voluntary Registry Offsets Database contains all carbon offset projects 
              listed globally by four major voluntary offset project registries: American Carbon Registry (ACR), 
              Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard, and Verra (VCS). These four registries generate almost all of the 
              world's voluntary market offsets and include projects eligible for use under the California, Quebec, and Washington 
              lcap-and-trade programs as well as UN Clean Development Mechanism projects that transitioned into one of the 
              voluntary registries.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              All information for Carbon AIQ is stored in the 'Download Data' tab of our website. This lists all projects in all 
              registries and can be filtered/sorted using drop-down menus. Each offset credit nominally represents one metric 
              tonne of CO2-equivalent reduced or removed from the atmosphere.
